<h1>Game Catalog</h1>
<p>The <em>Games</em> page lists all of the games available on the Hark the Sound site. You can browse all of the available games, search for certain games, read about games, and choose a game to play.</p>

<p>You can interact with the game catalog in two ways.<p>
  
<ol>
  <li>You can listen to the site read aloud game categories and game titles as you use the arrow keys to navigate. (Basic)</li>
  <li>You can page through the catalog, enter search terms, and view game details using the mouse, keyboard, and screen. (Advanced)</li>
</ol>
  
<h1>Basic Interface</h1>
<h2>Browsing Categories</h2>
<p>When the <em>Games</em> page first loads, you can start listening to the available game categories by pressing the <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> arrow keys. Press the <em>Down</em> arrow to hear more information about the current category. Press the <em>Up</em> error to select a category and begin browsing its games. </p>
  
<p>The category list wraps from the end to beginning and beginning to end when you navigate past the first or last category. Listen for a short sound to know that you have wrapped.</p>

<h2>Browsing Games</h2>
<p>After selecting a category, navigate forward and backward through its list of games using the <em>Right</em> and <em>Left</em> arrow keys. Press the <em>Down</em> arrow one or more times to hear additional information about the current game. Press the <em>Up</em> arrow to start playing the selected game.</p>

<p>Unlike the category list, the game list does not wrap. A short sound plays to indicate that you have reached the beginning or end of the list. If you navigate the list quickly, the page may prompt you to wait while it loads additional game titles.</p>

<p>To cease browsing the games list and return to the category list, press the <em>Escape</em> key.</p>

<h1>Advanced Interface</h1>
<h2>Browsing Games</h2>
<p>When the <em>Games</em> page first loads, up to ten games in the catalog appear on the page. Scroll the page to see their tiles and descriptions. If additional games are available, a link appears at the bottom of the page to fetch additional games. Click the link to view more games. Repeat the process to continue viewing the available games.</p>

<h2>Entering Search Terms</h2>
<p>The game catalog is likely to grow quite large. You can limit what games appear on the page using the search box near the top of the page.<p>

<p>To filter the game results, click the combo box labeled <em>Enter search terms</em> near the top of the page. Enter a word or words to filter the available games by their titles, descriptions, or categories. Press the <em>Enter</em> key to show up to ten games containing your search terms. Then, follow the instructions above for browsing the matching games.</p>

<p>As you type search terms, a drop down appears showing common game categories that match your text. Use the <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em> arrow keys to highlight a category of interest and press <em>Enter</em> to select it as your search term. Or, use the mouse to click the category name in the drop down. In either case, the games list updates to show only those games in the selected category.</p>

<p>To view the game categories without typing, click the down arrow on the right side of the combo box. Then use the keys or mouse to select a category to view in the drop down.</p>
